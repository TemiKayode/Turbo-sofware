# PWA Icons Required

To complete PWA setup, you need to add the following icon files to the `public` folder:

- `pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels PNG icon
- `pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels PNG icon
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels for iOS
- `favicon.ico` - Standard favicon

You can generate these icons from your logo using tools like:

The manifest.json is automatically generated by vite-plugin-pwa during build.
